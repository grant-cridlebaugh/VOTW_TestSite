This is a demonstration of powershell based attacks for a presenttaion I am doing. The site promises free video games but instead downloads a ps1 file. The file, when executed, preforms a 'dos attack' which is just pinging google.com 10 times.
There is now another file under the 'Fast Download' link. This one actually does privilege escalation if you run it as admin. Don't download that file and run it as admin.
